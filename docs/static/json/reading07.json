This means you can assign functions to variables and pass\nthem as arguments to other functions, which allows for function ____.</p>\n\n<p>Two common higher-order functions in Python are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n  <li>____: This function takes in a function and applies it to each item\n  in an iterable to create a new iterable object.</li>\n  \n  <li>____: This function takes in a function and applies it to each item\n  in an iterable to create a new iterable object that contains only\n  elements that returned <tt>True</tt>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>To create anonymous functions that we can pass to the higher-order\nfunctions above, we can use ____ expressions.</p>\n\n<p>Because the two higher-order functions above return iterables rather\nthan lists, we can re-write them using ____, which are a more Pythonic\nway of making lists.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than materializing or populating a whole list, we can produce\nitems one-by-one using a ____ function that contains the\n<b><tt>yield</tt></b> keyword.</p>\n"
