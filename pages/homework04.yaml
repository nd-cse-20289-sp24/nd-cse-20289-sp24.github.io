  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you to practice writing
  [Python] scripts to create simple [Unix] filters or utilities that utilize
  [data structures] such as [lists] and [dicts].

  For this assignment, record your scripts and any responses to the following
  activities in the `homework04` folder of your **assignments** [GitHub]
  repository and push your work by **noon Saturday, February 24**.

  [wc]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html

  ## Activity 0: Preparation

  Before starting this homework assignment, you should first perform a `git
  pull` to retrieve any changes in your remote [GitHub] repository:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/repository                   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Get any remote changes not present locally

  Next, create a new branch for this assignment:

      :::bash
      $ git checkout -b homework04              # Create homework04 branch and check it out

  ### Task 1: Skeleton Code

  To help you get started, the instructor has provided you with the following **skeleton code**:

      ::bash
      # Go to homework04 folder
      $ cd homework04

      # Download Makefile
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework04/Makefile

      # Download Python skeleton code
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework04/cut.py
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework04/wc.py

  Once downloaded, you should see the following files in your `homework04` directory:

      :::bash
      homework04
          \_ Makefile     # This is the Makefile building all the assignment artifacts
          \_ cut.py       # This is the Python script for the cut utility
          \_ wc.py        # This is the Python script for the wc utility

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> DocTests

  You may notice that in addition to the usual comments and `TODOs`, the
  [docstrings] of each method also contains a few [doctests].

  You are **not** to modify these [doctests] and must keep them in-place. They
  are used to verify the correctness of your code.

  Your code goes **below** the [docstrings], where the `TODO` and `pass`
  commands are (you may remove the pass once you complete the method).

  </div>

  [docstrings]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/
  [doctests]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html

  ### Task 2: Initial Import

  Now that the files are downloaded into the `homework04` folder, you can
  **commit** them to your [git] repository:

      :::bash
      $ git add Makefile                            # Mark changes for commit
      $ git add *.py
      $ git commit -m "Homework 04: Initial Import" # Record changes

  ### Task 3: Unit Tests

  After downloading these files, you can run the `make` command to run the
  tests.

      :::bash
      # Run all tests (will trigger automatic download)
      $ make

  You will notice that the Makefile downloads these additional test data and scripts:

      :::bash
      homework04
          \_ cut.input    # This is the input file for the cut test script
          \_ cut.test     # This is the Python test for the cut utility
          \_ wc.input     # This is the input file for the wc test script
          \_ wc.test      # This is the Python test for the wc utility

  In addition to the embedded [doctests] in the **skeleton code**, you will be
  using these [unit tests] to verify the correctness and behavior of your code.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Automatic Downloads

  The `test` scripts are automatically downloaded by the `Makefile`, so any
  modifications you do to them will be lost when you run `make` again. Likewise,
  because they are automatically downloaded, you do not need to `add` or `commit`
  them to your [git] repository.

  </div>

  The details on what you need to implement for this assignment are described
  in the following sections.

  ## Activity 1: Cut (4.5 Points)

  For the first activity, you are to re-create a simplified version of the [cut] filter:

      :::bash
      # Display usage message
      $ ./cut.py -h
      Usage: cut -d DELIMITER -f FIELDS

      Print selected parts of lines from stream to standard output.

          -d DELIMITER    Use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
          -f FIELDS       Select only these fields
      $ echo $?
      0

      $ ./cut.py
      Usage: cut -d DELIMITER -f FIELDS

      Print selected parts of lines from stream to standard output.

          -d DELIMITER    Use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
          -f FIELDS       Select only these fields
      $ echo $?
      1

      # Extract the first field
      $ echo 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' | ./cut.py -d , -f 1
      Harder

      # Extract the second and fourth fields
      $ echo 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' | ./cut.py -d , -f 2,4
       Better, Stronger

      # Extract the first field with test input (first four lines)
      $ ./cut.py -d , -f 1 < cut.input | head -n 4
      Work it
      Do it
      Harder
      Faster

  The `cut.py` script reads input from [standard input] and takes two possible
  flags:

  - `-d`: This allows the user to specify a `DELIMITER`.  By default, it is the
    `TAB` character (ie. `\t`).

  - `-f`: This allows the user to specify which fields to select.  The user
    **must** specify this flag, otherwise it should result in a usage message
    and a failure exit status as show above.

  As with [cut], `cut.py` processes each line from [standard input] by
  splitting the line by the `DELIMITER`, combining specified `FIELDS` by the
  `DELIMITER`, and then printing out the resulting selection.

  [standard input]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)

  ### Task 1: `cut.py`

  To build this filter, you will need to complete the `cut.py` [Python] script
  by implementing the following functions:

  1. `strs_to_ints(strings: list[str]) -> list[int]`

      > This function converts a list of `strings` into a list of [int]s.

  2. `cut_line(line: str, delimiter: str='\t', fields: list[int]=[]) -> list[str]`

      > This function splits the given `line` by the `delimiter` and returns a
      [list] containing only the specified `fields`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint:** Consider what you want to loop over and how you can use a
      `try/except` to handle `IndexError`s.

      </div>

  3. `cut_stream(stream=sys.stdin, delimiter: str='\t', fields: list[int]=[]) -> None`

      > This function calls `cut_line` on each line in `stream` with the
      specified `delimiter` and `fields`.  It joins each result from `cut_line`
      with the `delimiter` and then prints out the selection.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint:** Consider using [str.rstrip] to remove trailing whitespace from
      each line while using [str.join] to combine the selections extracted from
      each line.

      </div>

  4. `main(arguments=sys.argv[1:], stream=sys.stdin) -> None`

      > This function processes the command-line `arguments` to determine the
      user specified `DELIMITER` and `FIELDS` (as described above) and then
      calls `cut_stream` with the given `stream` and computed `DELIMITER` and
      `FIELDS`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint:** Consider when to use `strs_to_ints` and how to check if the
      user did not specify any `FIELDS`.

      </div>

  [str.rstrip]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `cut.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest cut.py -v
      ...
      2 items had no tests:
          cut
          cut.usage
      4 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in cut.cut_line
         1 tests in cut.cut_stream
         1 tests in cut.main
         1 tests in cut.strs_to_ints
      4 tests in 6 items.
      4 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test-cut
      Testing Cut ...
      test_00_doctest (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_01_mypy (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_02_strs_to_ints (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_03_cut_line (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_04_cut_stream (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_05_main_usage (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_06_main_1 (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_07_main_1_2 (__main__.CutTest) ... ok
      test_08_main_1_2_4 (__main__.CutTest) ... ok

         Score 4.50 / 4.50
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 9 tests in 0.052s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./cut.test -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./cut.test -v CutTest.test_01_mypy
      ...

  To manually check your types, you can use [mypy]:

      :::bash
      # Run mypy to check types
      $ mypy cut.py

  To use the test input with the script, you can utilize [I/O redirection]:

      :::bash
      # Run script with input
      $ ./cut.py -d , -f 1 < cut.input
      ...

  [I/O redirection]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)
  [mypy]: https://mypy-lang.org/

  ## Activity 2: WC (4.5 Points)

  For the second activity, you are to re-create a simplified version of the [wc] utility:

      :::bash
      # Display usage message
      $ ./wc.py -h
      Usage: wc.py [-l | -w | -c]

      Print newline, word, and byte counts from standard input.

      The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
      the following order: newline, word, byte.

          -c      Print byte counts
          -l      Print newline counts
          -w      Print word counts

      # Count newlines, words, and bytes:
      $ echo Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage | ./wc.py
      1 13 53

      # Count only newlines
      $ ./wc.py -l < wc.input
      18

  The `wc.py` script reads input from [standard input] and takes three possible flags:

  - `-c`: This allows the user to specify that the program should print **byte** counts.
  - `-l`: This allows the user to specify that the program should print **newline** counts.
  - `-w`: This allows the user to specify that the program should print **word** counts.

  As with [wc], `wc.py` computes the newline, word, and byte counts of the data
  from [standard input] and prints out the selected counts.  If no options are
  specified, then all three options are reported.

  ### Task 1: `wc.py`

  To build this utility, you will need to complete the `wc.py` [Python] script
  by implementing the following functions:

  1. `count_stream(stream=sys.stdin) -> dict[str, int]`

      > This function counts the number of **newlines**, **words**, and
      **bytes** and returns a [dict] in the form: `{'newlines': ..., 'words': ...,
      'bytes': ...}`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Consider looping over the `stream` line-by-line, and consider
        how to handle possible `KeyError`s when updating the count for one of
        the options.

      </div>

  2. `print_counts(counts: dict[str, int], options: list[str]) -> None`

      > This function prints the `counts` of the specified `options`.  If no
      `options` are specified (e.g. `options` is an empty [list]), then all
      `options` are reported (ie. `newlines`, `words`, `bytes`).

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Consider what you should loop over and what you should search
        to determine if an option is selected or not.  Print the selected
        options by combining them with a space (ie. `' '`) delimiter.

      </div>

  3. `main(arguments=sys.argv[1:], stream=sys.stdin) -> None`

      > This function processes the command-line `arguments` to determine the
      user specified options, computes the counts using `count_stream` on
      `stream`, and then reports the counts using `print_counts`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Consider how to keep track of the `options` while looping
        through the arguments.

      </div>

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `wc.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest wc.py -v
      ...
      2 items had no tests:
          wc
          wc.usage
      3 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in wc.count_stream
         1 tests in wc.main
         1 tests in wc.print_counts
      3 tests in 5 items.
      3 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test-wc
      Testing WC ...
      test_00_doctest (__main__.WCTest) ... ok

      test_16_main_counts_newlines_bytes (__main__.WCTest) ... ok
      test_17_main_counts_words_bytes (__main__.WCTest) ... ok

         Score 4.50 / 4.50
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 18 tests in 0.108s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./wc.test -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./wc.test -v WCTest.test_01_mypy
      ...

  To manually check your types, you can use [mypy]:

      :::bash
      # Run mypy to check types
      $ mypy wc.py

  To use the test input with the script, you can utilize [I/O redirection]:

      :::bash
      # Run script with input
      $ ./wc.py < wc.input
      ...

  ## Activity 3: Quiz (2 Points)

  Once you have completed all the activities above, you are to complete the
  following **reflection quiz**:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework04.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework04/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To test your quiz, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking homework04 quiz ...
           Q01 0.30
           Q02 0.70
           Q03 0.20
           Q04 0.60
           Q05 0.20
         Score 2.00 / 2.00
        Status Success

  ## Guru Point (1 Extra Credit Point)

  For extra credit, you are to modify `wc.py` such that its output matches the
  exact formatting of [wc].  In our `wc.py`, we simply join multiple counts by
  a single space.  In the traditional [wc], however, it will compute the
  maximum width (ie. number of digits) of the selected counts and use that to
  organize the counts into evenly spaced columns.

  To accomplish this task, you must do the following:

  1. `wc2.py`: Copy `wc.py` to `wc2.py` and modify the `print_counts` function
    mimic the reporting behavior of [wc].

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Once you know the maximum number of digits from the selected
        counts, you can use [str.ljust] to format the count to a specific width.

      </div>

  2. `wc2.test`: Copy `wc.test` to `wc2.test` and modify the appropriate
    functions to compare the output of `print_counts` and `main` directly
    against the output of [wc].

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: You should reference how `cut.test` checks the output of [cut]
        in its [unit tests] (ie. it uses [subprocess.run] to execute [cut] and
        capture its output for comparison).

      </div>
