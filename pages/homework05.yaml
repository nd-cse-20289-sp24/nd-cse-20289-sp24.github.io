  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you to practice using
  [Python] to create scripts that require sophisticated parsing of data and
  manipulation of [data structures]. In this assignment, you will process data
  in both [CSV] and [JSON] format and then present the information to the user
  in the terminal.

  For this assignment, record your scripts and any responses to the following
  activities in the `homework05` folder of your **assignments** [GitHub]
  repository and push your work by **noon Saturday, March 2**.

  [JSON]: http://www.json.org/

  ## Activity 0: Preparation

  Before starting this homework assignment, you should first perform a `git
  pull` to retrieve any changes in your remote [GitHub] repository:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/repository                   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Get any remote changes not present locally

  Next, create a new branch for this assignment:

      :::bash
      $ git checkout -b homework05              # Create homework04 branch and check it out

  ### Task 1: Skeleton Code

  To help you get started, the instructor has provided you with the following **skeleton code**:

      ::bash
      # Go to homework05 folder
      $ cd homework05

      # Download Makefile
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework05/Makefile

      # Download Python skeleton code
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework05/namez.py
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp24/static/txt/homework05/searx.py

  Once downloaded, you should see the following files in your `homework05` directory:

      :::bash
      homework05
          \_ Makefile       # This is the Makefile building all the assignment artifacts
          \_ namez.py       # This is the Python script for the namez script
          \_ searx.py       # This is the Python script for the searx script

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> DocTests

  You may notice that in addition to the usual comments and `TODOs`, the
  [docstrings] of each method also contains a few [doctests].

  You are **not** to modify these [doctests] and must keep them in-place. They
  are used to verify the correctness of your code.

  Your code goes **below** the [docstrings], where the `TODO` and `pass`
  commands are (you may remove the pass once you complete the method).

  </div>

  [docstrings]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/
  [doctests]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  [unit test]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
  [unit tests]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing

  ### Task 2: Initial Import

  Now that the files are downloaded into the `homework05` folder, you can
  **commit** them to your [git] repository:

      :::bash
      $ git add Makefile                            # Mark changes for commit
      $ git add *.py
      $ git commit -m "Homework 05: Initial Import" # Record changes

  ### Task 3: Unit Tests

  After downloading these files, you can run the `make` command to run the
  tests.

      :::bash
      # Run all tests (will trigger automatic download)
      $ make

  You will notice that the Makefile downloads these additional test data and scripts:

      :::bash
      homework05
          \_ namez.input.gz       # This is the input file for the namez script
          \_ namez.input.test.gz  # This is the test input file for the namez script
          \_ namez.test           # This is the Python test for the namez script
          \_ searx.test           # This is the Python test for the searx script

  In addition to the embedded [doctests] in the **skeleton code**, you will be
  using these [unit tests] to verify the correctness and behavior of your code.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Automatic Downloads

  The `test` scripts are automatically downloaded by the `Makefile`, so any
  modifications you do to them will be lost when you run `make` again. Likewise,
  because they are automatically downloaded, you do not need to `add` or `commit`
  them to your [git] repository.

  </div>

  The details on what you need to implement for this assignment are described
  in the following sections.

  ## Activity 1: Namez (5 Points)

  For the first activity, you are to write a script called `namez.py`, which
  reads [CSV] data from the [Social Security Agency] containing all the names
  of babies born from `1880` to `2022`.

      :::bash
      # Display usage
      $ ./namez.py -h
      Usage: namez.py [-p -y YEARS] NAMES

      Print the counts for each NAME in the corresponding YEARS.

          -p          Show percentages instead of counts
          -y YEARS    Only display these YEARS (default: all)

      YEARS may be specified multiple times and can be a single year, or a list
      separated by commas, or a range separated by -:

          -y 2002 -y 2003 -y 2004
          -y 2002,2003,2004
          -y 2002-2004

      The YEARS are always displayed in ascending order, while the NAMES are
      displayed in the order provided.

      # Print counts for Peter and James in 1983
      $ ./namez.py -y 1983 Peter James
      Year       Peter       James
      1983        5525       36624

      # Print percentages for Peter and James from 1980 to 1985
      $ ./namez.py -y 1980-1985 -p Peter James
      Year       Peter       James
      1980     0.1746%     1.1494%
      1981     0.1744%     1.1150%
      1982     0.1660%     1.1172%
      1983     0.1595%     1.0574%
      1984     0.1628%     1.0349%
      1985     0.1597%     1.0129%

  The `namez.py` script takes the following possible flags:

  - `-p`: This has the script print out the percentage within the current year
    instead of the count for the baby name.

  - `-y`: This allows the user to specify which `YEARS` to print out.  There
    are three possible formats for this flag as noted in the **usage** above.

  After the flags, the remaining arguments are the `NAMES` to include in the
  table.

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">

  If an unsupported flag is specified, or if no `NAMES` are given, then
  `namez.py` should print out the **usage** message and exit with failure.

  </div>

  The baby names are stored in a [CSV] file, `namez.input.gz`, which is in the
  following format:

      :::text
      year,name,gender,count
      1880,Mary,F,7065
      1880,Anna,F,2604
      1880,Emma,F,2003
      1880,Elizabeth,F,1939
      1880,Minnie,F,1746
      1880,Margaret,F,1578
      1880,Ida,F,1472
      1880,Alice,F,1414
      1880,Bertha,F,1320
      ...

  Because the [CSV] file is so large, it has been compressed with [gzip], which
  means you will need to use [gzip.open] to read the file in [Python].
  Additionally, because the complete database is so large, it will take a few
  seconds to load.  For testing purposes, the [doctests] and some of the [unit
  tests] will verify the functionality of your program using
  `names.input.test.gz` instead, which is a reduced version of the complete
  [CSV] data.

  [gzip]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/
  [gzip.open]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html#gzip.open

  ### Task 1: `namez.py`

  To implement the `namez.py` [Python] script, you will need to complete the
  following functions:

  1. `load_database(path: str=PATH) -> Database`

      > This function reads the [CSV] data from the specified `path` and
      returns a [dict] that maps years to a [dict] with names mapped to counts (ie.
      `{YEAR: {NAME: COUNT}}`).

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: You can use the [csv.DictReader] function with [gzip.open] to
        read the [CSV] data.

          :::python
          for record in csv.DictReader(gzip.open(path, 'rt')):
              ...

      The [dict] you return has the *type alias*, `Database`, which can be used
      to annotate your [dict] variable:

          :::python
          database: Database = {}

      </div>

  2. `print_table(database: Database, years: list[int]=[], names: list[str]=[], percentage=False) -> None`

      > This function prints out a table of `years` and `names` (along with
      their corresponding counts or percentages).  The first column contains
      the year, while the second column contains the counts or percentages for
      the first name in the corresponding year, etc.  The first row is a header
      containing the word `year` and then each of the `names`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: The names can be aligned into columns by using [str.rjust] with
      a width of `12`.  Likewise, the counts should be aligned as follows:

          :::python
          f'{count:>12}'

      While percentages should be aligned as follows:

          :::python
          f'{percentage:>11.4f}%'

      You should considering collecting all the columns for each row into a
      [list] and then using [str.join] to combine them all into a single string
      for printing.
      </div>

  3. `main(arguments=sys.argv[1:]) -> None`

      > This function processes the command line `arguments`, loads the
      database, and then prints a table with specified `years` and `names`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: To convert a sequence of `str`s to `int`s, you can use either
      a [list comprehension]:

          :::python
          [int(s) for s in strs]

      Or the [map] function:

          :::python
          map(int, strs)

      To add all the elements of a [list] to an existing [list], you can use
      the [list.extend] method:

          :::python
          list1.extend(list2)

      </div>

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `namez.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest namez.py -v
      2 items had no tests:
          namez
          namez.usage
      3 items passed all tests:
         4 tests in namez.load_database
         1 tests in namez.main
         2 tests in namez.print_table
      7 tests in 5 items.
      7 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test-namez
      Testing NameZ ...
      test_00_doctest (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_01_mypy (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_02_load_database (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_03_print_table (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_04_main_usage (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_05_main_year_multiple (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_06_main_year_list (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_07_main_year_range (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok
      test_08_main_year_range_percentage (__main__.NamezTest) ... ok

         Score 5.00 / 5.00
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 9 tests in 21.071s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./namez.test -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./namez.test -v NamezTest.test_01_mypy
      ...

  To manually check your types, you can use [mypy]:

      :::bash
      # Run mypy to check types
      $ mypy namez.py

  [mypy]: https://mypy-lang.org/

  ## Activity 2: SearX (5 Points)

  For the second activity, you are to write a script called `searx.py`, which
  fetches search results from [searx.ndlug.org](https://searx.ndlug.org), a
  website running [SearXNG]:

  > [SearXNG] is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search
  engines while not storing information about its users.

  With this script, you can search the Internet right from your terminal!

      :::bash
      # Display usage
      $ ./searx.py
      Usage: searx.py [-u URL -n LIMIT -o ORDERBY] QUERY

      Fetch SearX results for QUERY and print them out.

          -u URL      Use URL as the SearX instance (default is: https://searx.ndlug.org/search)
          -n LIMIT    Only display up to LIMIT results (default is: 5)
          -o ORDERBY  Sort the search results by ORDERBY (default is: score)

      If ORDERBY is score, the results are shown in descending order.  Otherwise,
      results are shown in ascending order.

      # Search for notre dame
      $ ./searx.py notre dame
         1.   University of Notre Dame [4.00]
              https://www.nd.edu/

         2.   Notre-Dame de Paris [1.40]
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris

         3.   Notre Dame Athletics | The Fighting Irish [1.11]
              https://fightingirish.com/

         4.   University of Notre Dame [1.00]
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame

         5.   Notre Dame [1.00]
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame

      # Search for notre dame, limit to one result, order by title
      $ ./searx.py -n 1 -o title notre dame
         1.   2023 Notre Dame football schedule: Dates, times, TV channels, scores [0.05]
              https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2023-12-03/2023-notre-dame-football-schedule-dates-times-tv-channels-scores

  The `searx.py` script takes the following possible arguments:

    - `-u`: This allows the user to set the `URL` of the [SearXNG] instance to
      search.  By default, this is
      [https://searx.ndlug.org/search](https://searx.ndlug.org/search).

    - `-n`: This allows the user to limit the number of search results to print
      out.  By default, this is `5`.

    - `-o`: This allows the user to specify how to sort the results.  By
      default, it will sort by `score` in descending order.  Otherwise, it will
      sort either the `title` or `url` in ascending order.

  After the flags, the remaining arguments is the `QUERY` to search.

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">

  If an unsupported flag is specified, or if no `QUERY` is given, then
  `searx.py` should print out the **usage** message and exit with failure.

  </div>

  [SearXNG]: https://docs.searxng.org/

  ### Task 1: `searx.py`

  To implement the `searx.py` [Python] script, you will need to complete the
  following functions:

  1. `searx_query(query: str, url: str=URL) -> list[dict]`

      > This function makes a [HTTP] request to the [SearXNG] instance
      specified by `url` and returns the search results corresponding to
      `query`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: To fetch the results from [SearXNG], you will need to specify
      the following **parameters** when making a [HTTP] request:

          :::python
          {'q': query, 'format': 'json'}

      To do so, you can use [requests.get]:

          :::python
          requests.get(url, params=...)

      Remember that you want to return just the [list] of results inside the
      [JSON] data, and not the whole response.

      </div>

  2. `print_results(results: list[dict], limit: int=LIMIT, orderby: str=ORDERBY) -> None`

      > This function prints up to `limit` search `results` sorted by
      `orderby`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: Each search result should be printed out in the following
      format:

          :::python
          '{index:>4}.\t{title} [{score:0.2f}]'
          '\t{url}'

      **Note**: There should be a **blank line** between each search result,
        but not before the first result or after the last result.

      You should **sort** the results using [sorted] before **slicing** it up
      to the `limit`.  Remember that you can control how each element is compared
      in [sorted] by specifying a `key` function:

          :::python
          sorted(results, key=lambda r: r['score'], reversed=True)

      The code above would return a sequence of results ordered by `score`
      in **descending** order.

      </div>

  3. `main(arguments=sys.argv[1:]) -> None`

      > This function processes the command line `arguments`, fetches the
      search results for `QUERY`, and then prints out the results.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: You may wish to use [str.join] to combine the remaining
        arguments into a single `query`.

      </div>

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `searx.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest searx.py -v
      ...
      2 items had no tests:
          searx
          searx.usage
      3 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in searx.main
         1 tests in searx.print_results
         1 tests in searx.searx_query
      3 tests in 5 items.
      3 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      OK


  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./searx.test -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./searx.test -v SearxTest.test_01_mypy
      ...

  To manually check your types, you can use [mypy]:

      :::bash
      # Run mypy to check types
      $ mypy searx.py

  ## Activity 3: Quiz (1 Point)

  Once you have completed all the activities above, you are to complete the
  following **reflection quiz**:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework05.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework05/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To test your quiz, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking homework05 quiz ...
           Q01 0.50
           Q02 0.50
         Score 1.00 / 1.00
        Status Success

  ## Guru Point (1 Extra Credit Point)

  For extra credit, you are to **plot the counts of multiple names** from every
  year using the baby names database in `namez.py`.  To do so, you should use
  [matplotlib] inside a [Jupyter] notebook to plot multiple lines on a single
  graph as shown below:

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
    <img src="static/img/homework05-namez.png" class="img-responsive">
  </div>

  To run [Jupyter] on the student machines, you can use the following command:

      :::bash
      $ jupyter-notebook-3.11 --ip studentXX.cse.nd.edu --port 9000 --no-browser

  Replace `studentXX.cse.nd.edu` with the name of the student machine you are
  on.  Also, you may need to change the port to something else between `9000` -
  `9999`.

  Alternatively, you can use [Google Colaboratory] to run a [Jupyter] notebook
  from your Google Drive.  This is a hassle-free way to explore developing with
  [Python] and [matplotlib], while using Google Cloud resources (*thus no need
  for the VPN or the student machines*).

  #### <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Verification

  To get credit for this Guru Point, show your [Jupyter] notebook with the
  graphical plot to a TA to verify (or attached a video / screenshot to your
  **Pull Request**). You have up until a week **after** this assignment is due
  to verify your Guru Point.

  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> Self-Service Extension

  Remember that you can always **forgo** this Guru Point for **two extra days**
  to do the homework.  That is, if you need an extension, you can simply skip
  the Guru Point and you will automatically have until **Monday** to complete
  the assignment for full credit.

  Just leave a note on your **Pull Request** of your intentions.

  ## Submission

  To submit your assignment, please commit your work to the `homework05` folder
  of your `homework05` branch in your **assignments** [GitHub] repository.
  Your <tt>homework05</tt> folder should **only** contain the following files:

  - <tt>Makefile</tt>
  - <tt>answers.json</tt>
  - <tt>namez.py</tt>
  - <tt>searx.py</tt>

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note**: You do not need to commit the test scripts because the `Makefile`
  automatically downloads them.
  </div>

  #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Pull Request

  Remember to create a **Pull Request** and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 06 TA List].

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own **Pull Request**.  The TAs use open **Pull
  Requests** to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them
  yourself will cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
